# LeetCode Practice Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems.  
I use it as a way to practice problem-solving, strengthen my coding skills, and track my progress over time.  

## 📂 Structure
Each file corresponds to a specific problem and is named in a way that matches the challenge (e.g., `isAnagram.py`, `findTheDifference.py`).

## 🎯 Purpose
- Improve algorithmic thinking  
- Practice data structures (arrays, strings, hashmaps, etc.)  
- Build a strong foundation for coding interviews and real-world problem solving  

## 🚀 How to Use
```bash```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/LeetCodeProblems.git

# Navigate into the folder
cd LeetCodeProblems

# Run any solution file
python filename.py

## 📝 Notes
- These are my own solutions, written in Python.  
- Currently, I’m only practicing in Python, but in the near future I plan to follow the same path with C languages (C, C++, etc.).  
- I try to keep the code simple and well-commented.  
- Some problems may have multiple approaches (brute force, optimized).
