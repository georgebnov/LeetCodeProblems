# LeetCode Practice Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems.  
I use it as a way to practice problem-solving, strengthen my coding skills, and track my progress over time.  

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each file corresponds to a specific problem and is named in a way that matches the challenge (e.g., `isAnagram.py`, `findTheDifference.py`).

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
- Improve algorithmic thinking  
- Practice data structures (arrays, strings, hashmaps, etc.)  
- Build a strong foundation for coding interviews and real-world problem solving  

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/LeetCodeProblems.git
